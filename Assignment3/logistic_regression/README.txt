---  Logistic Regression  ---

	python3 logistic.py <train> <test> <eta> <sigma> <model>

Notes:

	I used 0.001 eta for testing
	I used 5 for sigma for testing

	The gradient doesn't really converge to anything like 0.00001.  Or else It would take a really long time on my computer.

	Accuracy = 94.2%
